                <p>This project is a collaboration between Tyrone Cragg and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liam-culligan-81156b11b?trk=hp-identity-name">Liam Culligan</a>.</p>
                
                <p>This app has been developed to provide an open-source, user-friendly interface to explore well-being throughout the world. Well-being at country-level is assessed using the concept of happiness which is a measure by which social progress across countries can be compared. This data is sourced from the <a href="http://worldhappiness.report/">2016 World Happiness Report</a> produced by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. At city level, well-being is assessed using the concept of liveability, which is a measure by which the living conditions of cities across the world can be compared. This data is sourced from the <a href="http://www.eiu.com/liveability2015">Global Liveability Ranking 2015</a> produced by the Economist Economic Intelligence Unit. Continents and regions are defined in accordance with the World Bank development indicators. All of the data used is publicly available.</p>
                
                <h3>Happiness</h3>
                
                <p>Simply put, six key variables, which have been broadly found in literature to be important in explaining differences in life evaluations at a national level, are used to calculate the happiness score for a city on a scale of 0 to 10:<br></p>

                <h3>Liveability</h3>
                
                <p>The liveability score for a city is calculated using category weights, which themselves are divided into equally weighted subcategories to ensure that the score covers as many indicators as possible. Indicators are scored as acceptable, tolerable, uncomfortable, undesirable or intolerable. These are then weighted to produce a rating, where 100 means that liveability in a city is ideal and 1 means that it is intolerable.</p>
                <p>For qualitative variables, an “Economist Intelligence Unit rating” (EIU rating) is awarded based on the judgment of in&ndash;house expert country analysts and a field correspondent based in each city. For quantitative variables, a rating is calculated based on the relative performance of a location using external data sources.</p>
